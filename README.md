# Hotel Message System

Created by Palmer Sola

## EDIT TO PROJECT

I believe I misunderstood the project and would like to resubmit. I just added command prompt support, allowing the user to navigate the project
much easier. The project details said no GUI neccesary, which I thought meant no command line either. Please review and reconsider, thank you.

### Installation and Use

To run this program, do the following:

- Clone repository into local directory
- In the terminal, navigate to the HotelMessageSystem folder
- Type npm i
- The variables are accessable to manipulate via the index.js file. There are comments leading towards which variables can be manipulated
- To run program use the command node index.js

### About

My first mental draft of this project was written in Java, but as soon as I realized my premium license for IntelliJ had ended, I switched to
JavaScript. I am more comfortable and familiar with JavaScript overall. I appreciate its flexibility, especially within the confines of a short,
simple project. This project is structured to focus on readability and organization, allowing others to understand the code quickly. I used models
for the objects because I love creating and using custom methods. There are two things I would change if I had more time to complete this.
First, I would add more error handling to the project. A few areas are handled, such as a system to ensure the hotel and guests' IDs are valid,
in addition to safeguards for the time greeting system. Unfortunately, I am out of town this weekend, meaning this project was completed quickly.
If I had more time, I would love to add GUI elements of some kind. Both command line and HTML options sound interesting.
